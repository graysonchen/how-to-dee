## What's all this then?
#### Let me present to you... me. 
This is a readme, a lá [How to Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/). It's not a _How To Work With Me_ readme, because Dee-at-$formerCompany is going to be very different from Dee-at-$yourCompany. It's not a manager readme either ([here's why](https://twitter.com/EricaJoy/status/994324414668849153)). Also, I just got here. I don't know anything. 

Instead, this document is intended to be a guide into how I think and work, my values, and my idiosyncrasies. This is a document I wish I'd had whenever I joined a new company. Humans are notoriously complicated, I'm tired half the time, and being explicit is a shortcut I need.

This is a living document. I update it as I discover new things about my working style. 

**If I applied to a job at your company:** Take this as a more verbose cover letter. My resumé tells you what I can do; this will tell you who I am. That said, this document is in flux, and changes depending on the company I'm at.

## As a human...
I was born to a Thai mother and a Japanese/Malay father. I grew up in Singapore, spending summers in balmy Chiang Rai. English is my third language — when I'm tired or frustrated, you might catch me slipping into Thai, Malay, or [Singlish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish). I'm a sci-fi geek, video game player, middling writerer, hobbyist developer, and I barbecue more food than strictly necessary. 

I never went to college, so everything I know I've cribbed together from Lynda, Coursera, and Stack Overflow. 

In the sense of being a [T-shaped person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), my vertical bar is primarily on [growth loops](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops) and marketing automation. This means I build systems that are deterministic, repeatable, and sustainable. Sometimes my experiments work. Sometimes they don't. My job is to find out which is which. 

Horizontally, I have broad (but shallower) experience with video production, PR, content marketing, PPC, and a bunch of other various and sundry skills. My technical background is purely on a hobbyist level. Currently, I'm experimenting with Kubernetes. 

## North Star Principles 
* **I believe in first principles reasoning.** To quote Aristotle: _In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements._
* **I don't know everything, and that's great.** I know my [Circle of Competence](https://fs.blog/2013/12/mental-model-circle-of-competence/), and I am actively working on expanding it while also staying inside its perimeter on mission-critical projects. This is otherwise known as the [Growth Mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/), which I try to apply to everything I do.
 
## Success Conditions 
* **I read every email I receive**. If I don't reply, it's usually because I have nothing to add. If we have a meeting and you send me something at least a few hours beforehand, I will read it.
* **I tend to prefer email as the initial method of kicking off an activity** or project, following which I prefer face-to-face and real-time communications. This is because via email, I can take the time to consider and list out next steps.
* **My internal ranking of importance/usefulness of communication** is, in order: in person, email, WhatsApp, Slack, [giant cavernous gap] Skype for Business. Note that phone calls are not in here — I receive phone calls so rarely that whenever I receive one I assume someone has died. 
* **I take constructive criticism.** I have many opinions, and all of them are open to being challenged. 
* **I believe in the compounding awesomeness of constantly fixing things.** Building new things is fun to me, but so is consistently optimizing that thing over time. This applies to everything, whether that's a marketing campaign or quality assurance. 

## Known Failure Modes
* **I dislike meetings with no agenda**. I heavily bias towards action, and while long meetings debating strategy and potential direction can be valuable, I believe starting is the best way to learn. When in doubt, [disagree and commit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit) This strategy not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.
* Many people work well with background noise. **I am not one of them.**
* **Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Dee, can you help with X?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“Dee, do X.”) I have been this way since I was a child and I probably need therapy. 
* **I love to start new things** and then lose interest when I can see how the thing is going to look finished. Oftentimes this is months before the thing actually _is_ finished. I'm working on it. Sorry.
